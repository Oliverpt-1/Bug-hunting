# Bug-hunting

This past summer, I spent time learning how to audit smart contracts and hunt for bugs.  I included a medium bag that was validated for the Zaros Trading Protocol, where offchain batched orders could be invalidated.  Security contests and bug hunting have helped me view smart contracts through a security and safety mindset, which has helped me write safer and cleaner code.
